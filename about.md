Hi, I'm Brandon. I'm a self-taught programmer and current medical student.
Although I spend most of my time learning medical stuff these days, I've always had a
strong interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Unfortunately,
I don't have a very quantitative background (I majored in Neuroscience in college)
so I'm attempting to teach myself the fundamentals and will share my journey on this blog.
